# Programs and Utilities for the Compilers course at NTUA

This public repository is intended for students taking the compilers course
at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece.

It is organized in directories named after the languages that are used for
the compiler writing project of the course.

Each of these directories contains:
 - Sample valid programs together with some input and corresponding result (sub-directory `programs`).
 - Sample erroneous programs of the language (sub-directory `programs-erroneous`).

Optionally, it may also contain: 
 - Generator of random syntactically correct programs (sub-directory `syntax_gen`).
 - Support for syntax highlighting when using Vim/NeoVim (sub-directory `vim`).
 - Support for syntax highlighting when using VS Code (sub-directory `vscode`).
